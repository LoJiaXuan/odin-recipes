        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here is the list of ingredients you would need to make this classic dessert:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2½ pounds cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1¾ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees <b>F</b> (200 degrees <b>C</b>). Lightly coat a 10 inch springform pan with spray oil. Note: You could use a 9x13 inch pan instead.</li>
            <li>To make the crust: Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 egg and 1/2 cup butter or margarine. Spread to the edges of the pan. Prick all over with a fork, then bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees <b>F</b>(200 degrees <b>C</b>). Allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Increase oven temperature to 475 degrees <b>F</b> (245 degrees <b>C</b>). In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 5 eggs and the yolks and mix thoroughly. Add cream and mix only enough to blend.</li>
            <li>Pour filling over crust and bake for 10 minutes at 475 degrees <b>F</b> (245 degrees <b>C</b>). Reduce temperature to 200 degrees <b>F</b> (95 degrees <b>C</b>) and continue to bake for one hour. Turn oven off, but leave cake in for another hour. Don't worry if it looks a little jiggly in the center.</li>
            <li>Chill overnight. This is imperative! If desired, top with your favorite fruit or serve plain.</li>
